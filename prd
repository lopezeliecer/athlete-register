## 4. Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements

* **FR01: Athlete Registration:** Ability for administrators and coaches to register new athletes with personal and sports-related details (name, age, weight, height, club affiliations, league rankings, etc.).
* **FR02: Training Creation & Management:** Functionality for coaches to create training sessions specifying exercise type, intensity, measurement (distance, time, heart rate, reps), and add them to a library.
* **FR03: Training Scheduling:** Calendar-based interface for coaches to schedule training sessions for individuals or groups, with options for recurring schedules (daily, weekly, custom).
* **FR04: Performance Data Entry:** Tools for coaches to record athlete performance data from training and competitions.
* **FR05: Performance Tracking & Visualization:** System to track personal bests, records, and display progress over time for athletes.
* **FR06: Competition Management:** Features to record competition details and individual athlete results, linking them to athlete profiles.
* **FR07: Payment Management:** System to record payment information, manage membership types, generate reminders, and potentially integrate with payment gateways (initially Chilean).
* **FR08: AI-Powered Analysis:** Module to analyze performance data and provide coaches with suggestions for training improvements.
* **FR09: User Dashboards:** Personalized dashboards for coaches and athletes providing relevant information (upcoming training, announcements, progress summaries).
